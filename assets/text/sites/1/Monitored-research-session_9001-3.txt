During monitored research session 9001-3 Dr Jonas Knecht was intentionally exposed to the adverse effects of SCP-9001. The experiment ultimately lead me to  incapacitate Dr Knecht via the use of airborn sedatives. Although Dr Knecht exhibited no signs of exposure for 106.4 seconds, after this period I observed irregular eye movements in Dr Knecht via the examination room camera. Although this irregular behaviour could be explained by stress, this hypothesis does not accord with my professional assessment of Dr Knecht's psychological state at the time of the experiment. Additionally, Dr Knecht's line of sight was later confirmed via video analysis to focus on the corners of the room, which is a known early indicator of the effects of SCP-9001. Although Dr Knecht did succumb to the effects SCP-9001, it is worth noting that he exceeded the average exposure time before the manifestation of anomalous effects by 45.9 seconds, or 43.1%.
