On 13/07/2017 Dr Jonas Knecht became the first victim of the effects of SCP-9001. SCP-9001's properties were discovered by Dr Knecht during monitored research session [9001-2].

**Addendum:** Recovery of Doctor Jonas Knecht

After exposure to the effects of SCP-9001, Dr Jonas Knecht departed Site-$$$ in secret owing to a warped section of fencing near Dr Knecht's offices. All of Dr Knecht's personal belongings were found hastily discarded a few meters outside the perimeter fence. Notable items include a number of valuable personal effects such as a mobile phone, a silver necklace, and a pair of prescription glasses. Dr Knecht evaded SCP personell for a total of 35 days by hiding within the forests surrounding Site-$$$. 

Dr Knecht was located when foundation personnel discovered a makeshift shelter almost 3km away from the border of Site-$$$. Within the shelter, Dr Knecht had constructed alcoves containing a variety of carved wooden prisms representing primitive shapes, with varying levels of attention paid to the exactness of their construction. Analysis of the wood samples showed that the most recent carvings were the most precise, while the earliest carvings were those with the most deviation from geometrically perfect shapes. Dr Knecht was described as "calm" and "lucid" by fellow researcher Dr Cynthia Jefferson when she located him near his shelter in the forests surrounding Site-$$$. 

Since Dr Knecht's excursion, henceforth known as incident 301-A, Dr Knecht has demonstrated no anomalous behaviours. Researchers that had worked with Dr Knecht in the past have reported no changes in his behaviour or character. To date, Dr Jonas Knecht's recovery from the advanced stages of SCP-9001's anomalous effects is unique in that Dr Knecht not only survived, but has made a complete recovery. An interview with Knecht on the day of his return to Site-$$$ follows.

**Addendum:** Interview with Dr Knecht - Day of Return to Site-$$$

Participants:	Dr Jonas Knecht (K) - Interviewee
				Site-$$$ Administrator Jason Muldova (M) - Interviewer

M: Good evening doctor. How are you feeling?

K: I feel no persisting anomalous effects.

M: Could you explain what these effects were exactly?

K: I had begun to fixate on geometric forms. Wherever I would look I would try to find flaws. I only found out something was wrong when Cynthia- Dr Jefferson pointed out that we were seeing things differently. 

M: If you knew you were suffering anomalous effects, why did you run from the people best equipped to help you?

K: Here there is too much that is not quite perfect. The walls are flat, but there are tiny deviations. The corners meet squarely, but not at a perfect 90 $degrees. When you see 9001, you can't believe there's anything that perfect, you want to prove that things like that aren't possible. Here I would have gone mad making measurements of every detail, but in the forest nothing is measured. There are no edges to check for straightness, no angles to align squarely.

M: Is that why you abandoned your possessions outside the fence?

K: Yes, I couldn't stop looking at the lenses of my glasses, even the seams of my coat. Walking away from Site-$$$ was one of the most difficult things I have ever done.

M: Did you make the carvings we found in your shelter?

K: Yes.

M: If you entered the forest to avoid geometric shapes, then why fill your surroundings with geometric carvings?

K: They were my way of practicing. I started by acclimatising myself to very rough carvings, and on each new day I refined the carvings a little more. By the time you found me, I was once again able to handle my most precise carvings without feeling the need to analyse them. I was able to accept that something like 9001 could exist. Perhaps 9001 is just the product of many cycles of improvements like I made to my carvings.

M: Very well. This concludes our interview doctor.

(M rises from his chair)

K: $$$$$$?

M: Yes doctor?

K: Will I be prescribed amnestics?

M: You will probably receive a course of class-C amnestics after a report has been made.

(Dr Knecht nods)
