**Item #:** SCP-9002

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-9002 is to be kept in any unoccupied accommodations at Site-302. All doors and windows should be locked and barred, and SCP-9002's quarters should be well lit and well furnished. Cameras must be installed such that the entirety of SCP-9002's quarters are fully visible. Any personnel seeking to interact with SCP-9002 must be supervised by an on-site psychologist. Access to SCP-9002's containment is limited to personnel with class 2 security clearance or higher.

**Addendum:**
As of supervised research session 9002-1, any staff with family are strongly discouraged from interacting with SCP-9002.

**Description:** 
SCP-9002 is a small animal with short brown fur. It stands 30cm high and exhibits features of primates such as a prehensile hands and feet (with opposable thumbs) as well as high intelligence and speech. Subjects exposed to SCP-9002 experience anxiety, shortness of breath and hyperventilation. Subjects engaging in conversation with SCP-9002 report a sense of fear that perons or objects which came up in conversation with SCP-9002 may come to harm. This effect is not mitigated even when the subject of conversation is present during interactions with SCP-9002 and is visibly unharmed. 

**Addendum:**
During interview 9002-1 it was determined that SCP-9002's effects do not apply to conversations regarding SCP-9001. This suggests that SCP-9002's effects do not extend to objects incapable of being damaged.    

**Interview 9002-1:**
Participants:   Dr Jonas Knecht (K) - Interviewer
				SCP-9002 (9002) - Interviewee
				Dr Cynthia Jefferson (J) - Surpervisor

K: Good morning 9002.

9002: Morning? Rainclouds there.

K: Mein Gott...

(K rushes to look out a window.)

K: You're right 9002, the morning is ruined.

(Knecht starts pacing the room, hyperventilating.)

J: Administering benzodiazepines.

(K's breathing returns to normal)

K: Thank you Cynthia.

9002: Who you?

K: Nobody, drop the subject. Have you heard of SCP-9001?

9002: Nine... one...

(K begins reading SCP-9001's file)

K: "SCP-9001 is a reflective black cuboid 10cm in diameter. One face of SCP-9001-"

(9002 begins running around the room, emitting monkey-like screeches)

K: Do we have the data we need?

J: Yes.
