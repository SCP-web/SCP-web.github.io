Dr. Jonas Knecht has been under internal surveillance as of 13/07/2017 due to involvement in incident 301-A. Dr Knecht's recovery from the effects of SCP-9001 subsequent to incident 301-A motivated the O5 council to establish this cognitohazard containment site tasked with investigating methods of combatting anomalous mental effects. 

Dr Knecht is currently placed in Site-25 in order to determine the extent of his cognitoresistant capabilities, and contain any anomalous activity resulting therefrom. It is the judgsement of this site's administration that Dr Knecht need not be informed of any surveilance activites regarding his person. He is currently pursuing approved research into "safe" class cognitohazardous SCPs contained in Site-25, including SCP-9001.
