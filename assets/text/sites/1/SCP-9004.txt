**Item #:** SCP-9004

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-9004 is currently kept in the courtyard of Site-301. SCP-9004 should be kept in a natural environment where there is a steady flow of human traffic.

**Description:**
SCP-9004 is a stone head, 10.2m high, rendered in the Muiscan style. 

When left without human contact, or placed in artificial surroundings, SCP-9004 causes obsessive tendencies to manifest in anyone in its immediate proximity, with symptoms occurring in 80% of those exposed. Victims of SCP-9004's effects experience a sudden and strong desire to find something named "El Dorado". El Dorado has been described as all of a man, city, kingdom and empire, however all accounts agree that finding El Dorado will bring the finder great wealth. 

When SCP-9004 is frequented by large numbers of people, and placed in a natural environment, those in the immediate proximity of SCP-9004 report hearing pleasing melodies (see addendum 9004-2) although no electronic instruments have ever recorded sounds emanating from SCP-9004. In addition, feelings of mental clarity and peacefulness are commonly reported.

Class-2 amnestics are sufficient to negate the effects of SCP-9004.

**Addendum 9004-1:**
SCP-9004 was discovered in northern Colombia by a pilgrim henceforth referred to as SCP-9004-A. SCP-9004-A seems to be exempt from the effects of SCP-9004, positive or negative. The foundation was alerted to SCP-9004's presence when an archaelogical expedition acting on SCP-9004-A's information started experiencing SCP-9004's effects. After administering amnestics to the archaelogical group, SCP-9004 and SCP-9004-A were both transported to Site-301, however SCP-9004-A went missing during the trip, and has not been located since. 	

**Addendum 9004-1:**
Below is musical composition transcribed by SCP-9004-A based on her experience of SCP-9004's effects.
